# ABOUT #

This repository contains solutions to Euler Project problems solved in a bunch of languages and with a bunch of methods, mostly as I learned said languages and methods; for this reason, it may contain (hopefully temporary) poor judgement, dubious experiments and less-than-ideal ideations, basically for the pedagogical purpose of playing around with things.
