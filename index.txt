001: sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000
     (contains isMultipleOf)
     #C++
002: sum of even-valued Fibonacci nos that do not exceed 4mil
     #C++
003: prime factorising, brute force
     (contains factorise)
     #C++
004: smallest palindrome product of three digit numbers
     #C++
005: smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20
     (contains prime sieve and prime getter up to specified
     because I was curious about relative efficiency)
     #C++
006: square of the sum - sum of the squares (too easy?)
     #C++
007: Nth prime number
     (contains prime getter up to nth number, also a bunch
     of random write function e.g. printVector)
     #C++
008: 1000-digit number in which to find 13 consecutive numbers
     which yield the highest product
     (contains a lot of string manipulation and finding in string)
     #C++
009: pythagorean triplet which adds up to 1000
     #C++
010: find sum of primes up to 2 000 000	  
     (contains a more decent prime collector - faster but keeps all
     primes collected in memory so keep that in mind)
     (also made a python version of prime collector)
     #C++/python
011: find largest product in text grid in any direction
     #python
012: find first triangle number with over 500 factors
     (contains py prime getter and up to prime getter)
     #python
013: large number sum, python supports arbitrarily large int so easy
014: longer Collatz sequence under a million, caching calculated ones
     so it runs slightly quicker, and discounting powers of two (this
     does mean that the number of terms in the sequences is slightly off)
     #python
015: paths through a 20x20 grid only moving right and down, used an
     analytical expression, just quicker
     #Mathematica/python
016: sum of 2**1000 digits
     #python
017: writing out numbers from 1 to 1000 in words (with certain conventions)
     (contains general number-to-word function)
     #python
