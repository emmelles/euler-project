001: sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000
     (contains isMultipleOf)
002: sum of even-valued Fibonacci nos that do not exceed 4mil
003: prime factorising, brute force
     (contains factorise)
004: smallest palindrome product of three digit numbers
005: smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20
     (contains prime sieve and prime getter up to specified
     because I was curious about relative efficiency)
006: square of the sum - sum of the squares (too easy?)
007: Nth prime number
     (contains prime getter up to nth number, also a bunch
     of random write function e.g. printVector)
008: 1000-digit number in which to find 13 consecutive numbers
     which yield the highest product
     (contains a lot of string manipulation and finding in string)
009: pythagorean triplet which adds up to 1000
010: find sum of primes up to 2 000 000	  
     (contains a more decent prime collector - faster but keeps all
     primes collected in memory so keep that in mind)
